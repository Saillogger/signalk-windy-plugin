# Signal K Plugin for Windy

In some ways, all boats are weather stations. This plugin gathers environment data from boat instruments and sends information to Windy as a Personal Weather Station (PWS). It supports wind speed, wind direction, temperature, pressure and humidity.

Pre-requisites:
  * Wind and temperature sources on the Signal K server (barometer and humidity are optional)
  * [signalk-derived-data](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-derived-data) plugin
  * An API key that can be obtained from [Windy](https://stations.windy.com/stations)
