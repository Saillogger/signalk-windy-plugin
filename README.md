# Signal K Plugin for Windy

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itemir/signalk-windy/master/signalk-windy-screenshot.png' align='left' width='300' hspace='25' vspace='10'>In some ways, all boats are weather stations. This plugin gathers environment data from boat instruments and sends information to Windy as a Personal Weather Station (PWS). It supports wind speed, wind direction, temperature, pressure and humidity.

Pre-requisites:
  * Wind and temperature sources on the Signal K server (barometer and humidity are optional)
  * [signalk-derived-data](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-derived-data) plugin
  * An API key that can be obtained from [Windy](https://stations.windy.com/stations)
